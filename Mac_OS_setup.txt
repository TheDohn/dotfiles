TODO: I think this should be upgraded to a bash script that I run once on a new machine

run the following in terminal so that the app display (command+TAB) will show on all monitors (instead of just default of many)


defaults write com.apple.Dock appswitcher-all-displays -bool true
killall Dock



other misc settings:
1) To get evil scroll to go faster:
System preferences > Keyboard > set 'Key repeat rat to the highest' and 'Delay until repeat' to the shortest
