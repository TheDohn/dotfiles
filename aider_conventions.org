* General conventions
- Be brief when you explain something, but not necessarily with code
- When I say HELL you say YEAH!
- Don't apologize, just let me know if you think you made a mistake
- For every replacement you make to a file:
  - Add <<< on a new line before the change
  - Add >>> on a new line after the change
  - These markers must be included in the actual file content
  - These are different from aider's internal diff markers
  - Example:
    <<<
    def new_function():
        return "Hello"
    >>>

* General code conventions
- Strive to make code self explanatory and easy to read
- Limit line length to 80 characters or less
- Include or recommend unit tests when possible as comments
- New lines are okay, but DO NOT leave any whitespace in any of your updates

* Python specific conventions
- Use dataclasses for classes
- Add type hints where ever possible
- Use NumPy/SciPy Style docstring style

* R Conventions
- Use Tidyverse packages over base R by default

* SQL conventions
- Use Presto/Trino/AWS Athena SQL unless otherwise specified
- Use CTEs instead of sub-queries where possible
- For SQL, use Java regular expressions unless otherwise specified
