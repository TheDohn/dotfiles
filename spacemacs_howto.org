#+TITLE: How to do stuff in Spacemacs

* searching

** in a project

- install ag (the silver searcher)
- this is accessible via SPC-s-a-<family>, but likely will be default for SPC-/ now too
- after using SPC-s-a-<> to search project or files you can type C-C C-e to make that editable
  (or use control-z for help, which tells you to use f4)

- I can't use control-n to edit that, but you can use SPC-s-e

** in a file

*** swoop

SPC-s-s
- nice that it consolidates all hits
- you can loose context though as a result

*** iedit

SPC-s-e
- hard bc you immediately get all hits in file, and you aren't sure where they are
- usually I just type S-J to start selecting lines below that so you aren't selecting the whole file

** select instances

*** evil make cursor

C-n

- will give multiple cursors on a object, one-by-one, which is nice for just editing limited instance on screen
- g-r-q to quit multiple cursors

*** dump-jump-go

typically need to access this function by name (M-x, dumb-jump-go)
- I needed to bind this to gd to make it easy to access

** within files or directories

*** helm-do-ag:
- SPC-s-a-f
- then hit CTR-SPC to select files OR whole directories to search

** for file or directory names:

*** find-name-dired:
- SPC-f-d
- have to select one directory (can't do CRT-SPC but I bet there is another option to do this somewhere)
- * is the wildcard here

* org mode
* ess
* Python
- treesitter - this gives syntax highlighting
- lsp gives context pop ups for functions etc.
** switching and assigning REPLs:

from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49886186/emacs-starting-a-new-inferior-python-shell-when-evaluating-buffer

1) Use the M-x rename-buffer command to set the existing inferior shell buffer name to something like =*Python-otherbuff*=
(note that in the above there are ='s in org mode so that should render as Python-otherbuff with *'s surrounding it)
- you NEED to have these for it to work!
2) (setq-local python-shell-buffer-name "Python-otherbuff") in each buffer which should interact with the old inferior shell.
- just quotes here, no *s
- M-x eval-expression to get a prompt to run the snippet in the ()s above

* window/project management
** tab-bar-mode
- combine this with desktop-save to save the states
- this works pretty well but I don't like that you can't hide/show the tabs, so they take up space
** spacemacs layouts
- save/load layouts saves the buffers to open as well (just not a REPL)
- one way to start a new layout is SPC-p-l

* getting help

** describe buffer
- C-h b will give a list of commands in a buffer (like org or dired)
