#+TITLE: How to do stuff in Spacemacs

* searching

** in a project

- install ag (the silver searcher)
- this is accessible via SPC-s-a-<family>, but likely will be default for SPC-/ now too
- after using SPC-s-a-<> to search project or files you can type C-C C-e to make that editable

** for a file

***  swoop

SPC-s-s
- nice that it consolidates all hits
- you can loose context though as a result

*** iedit

SPC-s-e
- hard bc you immediately get all hits in file, and you aren't sure where they are
- usually I just type S-J to start selecting lines below that so you aren't selecting the whole file

** select instances

*** evil make cursor

C-n

- will give multiple cursors on a object, one-by-one, which is nice for just editing limited instance on screen
- g-r-q to quit multiple cursors


*** dump-jump-go

typically need to access this function by name (M-x, dumb-jump-go)
- I needed to bind this to gd to make it easy to access

* org mode
* ess
* Python
* window/project management
** tab-bar-mode
- combine this with desktop-save to save the states
- this works pretty well but I don't like that you can't hide/show the tabs, so they take up space
** spacemacs layouts
- save/load layouts saves the buffers to open as well (just not a REPL)
